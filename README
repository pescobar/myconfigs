I NO LONGER USE THIS REPO. NOW I USE YADM [https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/) WIHT A PRIVATE REPO

just my screen and vim configs.

to customize screen see .screenrc and ~/.screen-profiles/status

vim configured to work with bash and python files
also configured to easily comment many different filetypes (NERD_commenter plugin)

keybindings configured to not overwrite each other.
