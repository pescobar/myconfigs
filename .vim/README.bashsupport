README for bash-support.vim (Version 2.12) / June 29 2009

Bash Support implements a bash-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably
speed up writing code in a consistent style.  This is done by inserting
complete statements, comments, idioms, and code snippets.  Syntax checking,
running a script, starting a debugger  can be done with a keystroke.  There
are many additional hints and options which can improve speed and comfort when
writing shell scripts.

  INSTALLATION
=======================================================================================

The subdirectories in the zip archive  bash-support.zip  mirror the directory structure 
which is needed below the local installation directory $HOME/.vim/ .

(1) Copy the zip archive  bash-support.zip to $HOME/.vim and run

      unzip bash-support.zip

    If you have already an older version of bash-support and you have modified the
    template files you may want to save your templates first or copy the files from the 
    archive by hand.

(2) Set at least some personal details into .vimrc by overriding some defaults.
    Here the minimal personalization (my settings as an example, of course):

      let g:BASH_AuthorName   = 'Dr.-Ing. Fritz Mehner'     
      let g:BASH_AuthorRef    = 'Mn'                         
      let g:BASH_Email        = 'mehner@fh-swf.de'            
      let g:BASH_Company      = 'FH Südwestfalen, Iserlohn'    

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of template files and tags
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  bash dictionary for keyword completion
  *  removing the root menu

Restart gVim/Vim generate the help tags 

  :helptags ~/.vim/doc

and look at the bashsupport help with

  :help bashsupport

=======================================================================================
  ADDITIONAL TIPS
=======================================================================================

(1) gvim. Toggle 'insert mode' <--> 'normal mode' with the right mouse button
    (see mapping in file customization.gvimrc).

(2) gvim. Use tear off menus and

(3) try 'Focus under mouse' as window behavior (No mouse click when the mouse
    pointer is back from the menu entry).

(4) Use Emulate3Buttons "on" (X11) even for a 3-button mouse. Pressing left and
    right button simultaneously without moving your fingers is faster then 
    moving a finger to the middle button (often a wheel).
